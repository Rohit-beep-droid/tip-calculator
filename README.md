## Notes

Understanding and implementing code in Swift absorbed majority of the developement time.
The syntax took a bit to get used to however became intuitive shortly after. Required
a lot of research and patience to implement the features deemed to be necessary to make
the application look pleasing. Overall, it was a very entertaining and rare opportunity
to develope an application for iOS devices.
